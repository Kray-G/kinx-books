This is the first book which sums up with a whole image and features of Kinx.

This book will let you know the whole image of the purpose and the background, and what you can do with Kinx.

To make you realise about the **"Looks like JavaScript, feels like Ruby, it is a scripting language fitting in C programmers"** which is the concept of Kinx, so this book is structured as a person who never use Kinx can understand a whole thing, and a person who has already used Kinx will be also able to find something new.

This book will be sure to make it wider of the width of use.
